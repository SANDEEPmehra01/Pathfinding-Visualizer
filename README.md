## Algorithms  

### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm  
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a weighted pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path. Ideal for scenarios involving edge weights or costs.

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
BFS is an unweighted algorithm that ensures the shortest path in unweighted graphs by exploring neighbors level by level.

### 3. Depth-First Search (DFS)  
DFS explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. Itâ€™s effective for general exploration but does not guarantee the shortest path.
